## JASON OWEN HUNTER - Certified Detoxification Specialist, Permaculture Designer, Mucusless Diet Expert

Jason has walked many paths during this life journey. He has a passion to be surrounded by urban and rural edible landscapes.

He has spent a majority of his early life building relationships with fruit bearing plants . A few of Jason's many paths have been; licensed contractor, Permaculture designer and teacher, as well as a co-founder of the Duluth Biodiesel Cooperative.

Jason's life has been full of many key learning experiences. Around one bend he found himself unable to walk after getting trampled by a large truck while on a job site. With a great passion to be an extreme athlete once again, Jason sought the teachings of several successful healers. This path led him to study Circular Strength Training with Olympic Coach, Scott Sonnon.

Currently Jason is a Holistic Health Coach and studies physics and the chemistry of physiological transformation. This path has enabled Jason to help people heal themselves from deep rooted health issues. He uses such tools as iridology, physiological analysis, Herbology and natural movements to bring the body back into balance. As you will see, Jason's passion to help regenerate living systems is overflowing.

## **Workshops Offered**

### **Mind Mapping (11 a.m. Saturday)**

Jason is passionate about increasing the potential of the human. He has learned a technique referred to as Mind Mapping, which has taken his mental experience to a heightened level.A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize information. Mind maps are often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank landscape page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those.Mind maps can be drawn by hand, either as "rough notes" during a lecture, meeting or planning session, for example, or as higher quality pictures when more time is available.Mind maps have the ability to be easily viewed for information access as well as being recalled upon because they get stored in the mind as a picture, and the brain loves pictures.

Jason will share basic principles and exciting examples of the Mind Mapping craft to help you increase your experience while at the event.

### **Mucusless Diet Healing System (3 p.m. Sunday)**

The Mucusless Diet Healing System was devised by the late Professor Arnold Ehret. Professor Ehret is one of the most important pioneering researchers and authors regarding the health and preservation of the human body. No other scientist, doctor, dietitian, or author has surpassed Ehret's work concerning the cause and cure of chronic disease and human illness. Through years of research Professor Ehret rediscovered that the human body is an "air-gas engine" that is powered exclusively by oxygen and that a diet consisting of starchless fruits and green-leafy vegetables (mucusless foods) is the only food fit to be eat by humans. Among other important writings, Ehret produced a brilliant dietetic treatise entitled The Mucusless Diet Healing System which offers a methodical approach to eating that can be used regardless of age, gender, race, or sickness to achieve superior health.

Jason will be sharing the fundamentals of the Mucusless Diet Healing System and stories of his own journey as well as many others within the healing system.
